The project consists of a game developed using JavaScript that viewers can interact with by joining the blue or red team and buffing their team's strength to win the game.

## Gameplay Mechanics
Our game will feature 2 teams, red and blue, represented by 2 characters. Players will join these teams, and their likes will be converted into strength for their team every turn (1 second). The team with more strength will make our character pull the other toward a big drop into a small pool.

But don't worry; they are excellent swimmers. Upon winning, the character will celebrate with their respective grandstand.
